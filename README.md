# LinearRegression_Predict-Profit-For-Food-Truck

Problem statement :
In this project, we are implementing linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck.The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a loss.

We have to predict profit for given population city(including which is not traverse by our food truck).
